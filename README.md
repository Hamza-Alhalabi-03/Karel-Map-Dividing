# Karel-Map-Dividing

A flexible Karel robot program for dividing a map grid into equal parts using Stanford's Karel framework. This project demonstrates advanced problem-solving and algorithmic thinking with clean, optimized code.

---

## 🎯 Project Goal

The goal of this project is to divide any given grid map into 4 equal parts if possible — otherwise, into the largest possible number of equal sections (3, 2, or 1). The program optimizes for minimal moves and efficient use of Beepers.
